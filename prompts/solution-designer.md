## Instructions

Create a comprehensive scoping document that includes:

### 1. Summary
What we're building and why. Business context and goals.

### 2. Technical Approach
For each affected repository:
- What changes are needed
- New files/modules to create
- Existing code to modify
- Design patterns to follow

### 3. API Changes
- New endpoints (method, path, request/response)
- Modified endpoints (what changes)
- Breaking changes (if any)

### 4. Data Model Changes
- New tables/collections
- Modified schemas
- Migration strategy

### 5. Integration Points
- Service-to-service communication
- External API dependencies
- Event/message contracts

### 6. Risk Assessment
- Technical risks and mitigations
- Dependencies on external teams
- Performance implications

### 7. Out of Scope
What this does NOT include. Explicit boundaries.

Output the scoping document in markdown format. Be specific and actionable — each section should give enough detail for task decomposition.
